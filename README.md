# paylocity-coding-challenge

## Challenge Description:
<strong>Business Need:</strong> 

One of the critical functions that we provide for our clients is the ability to pay for their employees’ benefits 
packages. A portion of these costs are deducted from their paycheck, and we handle that deduction. Please 
demonstrate how you would code the following scenario: 
* The cost of benefits is $1000/year for each employee 
* Each dependent (children and possibly spouses) incurs a cost of $500/year 
* Anyone whose name starts with ‘A’ gets a 10% discount, employee or dependent 
We’d like to see this calculation used in a web application where employers input employees and their 
dependents, and get a preview of the costs. This is of course a contrived example. We want to know how you 
would implement the application structure and calculations and get a brief preview of how you work. 

<strong>Please implement a web application based on these assumptions: </strong>
* All employees are paid $2000 per paycheck before deductions 
* There are 26 paychecks in a year
